* Goals for today Sat, 25-Mar-2017

** Org-mode related
   Keep in mind to only add shortcuts here that I am going to use. No need to get stuck up fiddling.

*** Finish [[http://orgmode.org/guide/][compact guide]]
*** Match the ORG shortcuts with

*** DONE Visibility Cycling (org-cycle)
    CLOSED: [2017-03-25 Sat 17:09]
    Cycling through the levels of visible contents

**** =TAB= : Visibility cycling of the subtree in buffer
     Cycles through the subtree visibility states
     1. =folded=
     2. =children=
     3. =subtree=

**** =SHFT-TAB= : Global visibility cycling in buffer
     Cycles through global visibility states as:
     1. =overview= : Show only top-level headlines.
     2. =contents= : Show all headlines of all levels, but no body text.
     3. =showall= : Show everything

**** =SPC-u-SPC-u-TAB= : Switch to startup visibility
     Startup visibility can be set per file by adding at the top

     =#+STARTUP: content=

     The value can be one of the global visibility states:
     1. =overview= : Show only top-level headlines. (DEFAULT)
     2. =contents= : Show all headlines of all levels, but no body text.
     3. =showall= : Show everything

**** =g-h= : Backward to higher level heading (outline-up-heading)

**** =g-j= : Next heading at the same level (org-forward-heading-same-level)

**** =g-k= : Previous heading at the same level (org-backward-heading-same-level)

**** =g-l= : Next heading (outline-next-visible-heading)


*** DONE Restructuring within buffer

     The new heading at the same level as the last one is created with the contents after the position of the cursor.

**** =SPC-m-h-s= : Insert a new subheading (org-insert-subheading)
     The new heading is created at a level below the last one, with the contents after the position of the cursor.

     Promote the current heading by one level. The subtree is not promoted.

**** =>= : Demote current heading by one level (org-metaright)

**** =SPC-m-S-h= : Promote current subtree by one level (org-promote-subtree)
     Promote the current subtree by one level.

**** =SPC-m-S-l= : Demote current subtree by one level (org-demote-subtree)
     Demote the current subtree by one level.

**** =SPC-m-S-k= : Move the current subtree up (org-move-subtree-up)

**** =SPC-m-S-j= : Move the current subtree down (org-move-subtree-down)
     Move the current subtree down past 1 headline of the same level.


*** DONE Sparse trees (org-sparse-tree)
    CLOSED: [2017-03-25 Sat 20:14]
    Create /sparse trees/ for selected information in an outline tree.
    The rest of the document is folded as much as possible.

    Press =RET= to undo the highlights.

**** =SPC-m-/-t= : Create sparse tree with all TODO entries

**** =SPC-m-/-T= : Create sparse tree with entries having specific TODO keyword
     Prompts further to choose the keyword, taken from the TODO keywords available for the buffer.

**** =SPC-m-/-m= : Create sparse tree with entries selected by a tags/property match

**** =SPC-m-/-p= : Create sparse tree with entries with chosen property and its value

**** =SPC-m-/-r= : Create sparse tree with entries matching a regular expression

**** =SPC-m-/-b= : Create sparse tree with entries with deadlines and schedules before a date

**** =SPC-m-/-a= : Create sparse tree with entries with deadlines and schedules after a date

**** =SPC-m-/-a= : Create sparse tree with entries with deadlines and schedules between a date range

**** =SPC-m-/-d= : Create sparse tree with entries with deadlines and schedules within =org-deadline-warning-days=


*** DOING Markup
    Make words *bold*, /italic/, _underlined_, =code=, ~verbatim~, and +strike-through+.

    - [ ] Add the keybindings for the changing / assigning markups as well.

**** DOING Plain lists
     There are three types of plain lists:
     - Unordered :: with items starting with '=-=', '=+=', or '=*='.
     - Ordered :: with items starting with '=1.=' or '=1)='.
     - Description :: use '=::=' to separate the /term/ from the descrption,


**** TODO Changing color of Markups
     The goal is to have the different markups to show up in some bright colors, like in atom for markdown files.

     Googling lead me to [[http://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/5889/how-to-highlight-text-permanently-in-org-mode][this stackexchange question]] with the following code to be added to =dotspacemacs/user-init ()= /I guess/:

     #+NAME: change color of markups
     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (add-to-list 'org-emphasis-alist
                    '("*" (:foreground "red")
                      ))
     #+END_SRC

     - [ ] Figure out how to change only the color, and keep other properties as is
     - [ ] Choose the colors you want to use, perhaps from [[https://github.com/promek/wombat-dark-syntax/blob/master/styles/colors.less][wombat-dark-syntax]].
